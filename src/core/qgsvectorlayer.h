/** \ingroup core
 * Represents a vector layer which manages a vector based data sets.
 *
 * The QgsVectorLayer is instantiated by specifying the name of a data provider,
 * such as postgres or wfs, and url defining the specific data set to connect to.
 * The vector layer constructor in turn instantiates a QgsVectorDataProvider subclass
 * corresponding to the provider type, and passes it the url.  The data provider
 * connects to the data source.
 *
 * The QgsVectorLayer provides a common interface to the different data types.  It also
 * manages editing transactions.
 *
 *  Sample usage of the QgsVectorLayer class:
 *
 * \code
 *     QString uri = "point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer";
 *     QgsVectorLayer *scratchLayer = new QgsVectorLayer(uri, "Scratch point layer",  "memory");
 * \endcode
 *
 * The main data providers supported by QGIS are listed below.
 *
 * \section providers Vector data providers
 *
 * \subsection memory Memory data providerType (memory)
 *
 * The memory data provider is used to construct in memory data, for example scratch
 * data or data generated from spatial operations such as contouring.  There is no
 * inherent persistent storage of the data.  The data source uri is constructed.  The
 * url specifies the geometry type ("point", "linestring", "polygon",
 * "multipoint","multilinestring","multipolygon"), optionally followed by url parameters
 * as follows:
 *
 * - crs=definition
 *   Defines the coordinate reference system to use for the layer.
 *   definition is any string accepted by QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::createFromString()
 *
 * - index=yes
 *   Specifies that the layer will be constructed with a spatial index
 *
 * - field=name:type(length,precision)
 *   Defines an attribute of the layer.  Multiple field parameters can be added
 *   to the data provider definition.  type is one of "integer", "double", "string".
 *
 * An example url is "Point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer&field=name:string(20)&index=yes"
 *
 * \subsection ogr OGR data provider (ogr)
 *
 * Accesses data using the OGR drivers (http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html). The url
 * is the OGR connection string.  A wide variety of data formats can be accessed using this
 * driver, including file based formats used by many GIS systems, database formats, and
 * web services.  Some of these formats are also supported by custom data providers listed
 * below.
 *
 * \subsection spatialite Spatialite data provider (spatialite)
 *
 * Access data in a spatialite database. The url defines the connection parameters, table,
 * geometry column, and other attributes.  The url can be constructed using the
 * QgsDataSourceUri class.
 *
 * \subsection postgres Postgresql data provider (postgres)
 *
 * Connects to a postgresql database.  The url defines the connection parameters, table,
 * geometry column, and other attributes.  The url can be constructed using the
 * QgsDataSourceUri class.
 *
 * \subsection mssql Microsoft SQL server data provider (mssql)
 *
 * Connects to a Microsoft SQL server database.  The url defines the connection parameters, table,
 * geometry column, and other attributes.  The url can be constructed using the
 * QgsDataSourceUri class.
 *
 * \subsection wfs WFS (web feature service) data provider (wfs)
 *
 * Used to access data provided by a web feature service.
 *
 * The url can be a HTTP url to a WFS server (legacy, e.g. http://foobar/wfs?TYPENAME=xxx&SRSNAME=yyy[&FILTER=zzz]), or,
 * starting with QGIS 2.16, a URI constructed using the QgsDataSourceUri class with the following parameters :
 * - url=string (mandatory): HTTP url to a WFS server endpoint. e.g http://foobar/wfs
 * - typename=string (mandatory): WFS typename
 * - srsname=string (recommended): SRS like 'EPSG:XXXX'
 * - username=string
 * - password=string
 * - authcfg=string
 * - version=auto/1.0.0/1.1.0/2.0.0
 *  -sql=string: full SELECT SQL statement with optional WHERE, ORDER BY and possibly with JOIN if supported on server
 * - filter=string: QGIS expression or OGC/FES filter
 * - restrictToRequestBBOX=1: to download only features in the view extent (or more generally
 *   in the bounding box of the feature iterator)
 * - maxNumFeatures=number
 * - IgnoreAxisOrientation=1: to ignore EPSG axis order for WFS 1.1 or 2.0
 * - InvertAxisOrientation=1: to invert axis order
 * - hideDownloadProgressDialog=1: to hide the download progress dialog
 *
 * The ‘FILTER’ query string parameter can be used to filter
 * the WFS feature type. The ‘FILTER’ key value can either be a QGIS expression
 * or an OGC XML filter. If the value is set to a QGIS expression the driver will
 * turn it into OGC XML filter before passing it to the WFS server. Beware the
 * QGIS expression filter only supports” =, !=, <, >, <=, >=, AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, IS NULL”
 * attribute operators, “BBOX, Disjoint, Intersects, Touches, Crosses, Contains, Overlaps, Within”
 * spatial binary operators and the QGIS local “geomFromWKT, geomFromGML”
 * geometry constructor functions.
 *
 * Also note:
 *
 * - You can use various functions available in the QGIS Expression list,
 *   however the function must exist server side and have the same name and arguments to work.
 *
 * - Use the special $geometry parameter to provide the layer geometry column as input
 *   into the spatial binary operators e.g intersects($geometry, geomFromWKT('POINT (5 6)'))
 *
 * \subsection delimitedtext Delimited text file data provider (delimitedtext)
 *
 * Accesses data in a delimited text file, for example CSV files generated by
 * spreadsheets. The contents of the file are split into columns based on specified
 * delimiter characters.  Each record may be represented spatially either by an
 * X and Y coordinate column, or by a WKT (well known text) formatted columns.
 *
 * The url defines the filename, the formatting options (how the
 * text in the file is divided into data fields, and which fields contain the
 * X,Y coordinates or WKT text definition.  The options are specified as url query
 * items.
 *
 * At its simplest the url can just be the filename, in which case it will be loaded
 * as a CSV formatted file.
 *
 * The url may include the following items:
 *
 * - encoding=UTF-8
 *
 *   Defines the character encoding in the file.  The default is UTF-8.  To use
 *   the default encoding for the operating system use "System".
 *
 * - type=(csv|regexp|whitespace|plain)
 *
 *   Defines the algorithm used to split records into columns. Records are
 *   defined by new lines, except for csv format files for which quoted fields
 *   may span multiple records.  The default type is csv.
 *
 *   -  "csv" splits the file based on three sets of characters:
 *      delimiter characters, quote characters,
 *      and escape characters.  Delimiter characters mark the end
 *      of a field. Quote characters enclose a field which can contain
 *      delimiter characters, and newlines.  Escape characters cause the
 *      following character to be treated literally (including delimiter,
 *      quote, and newline characters).  Escape and quote characters must
 *      be different from delimiter characters. Escape characters that are
 *      also quote characters are treated specially - they can only
 *      escape themselves within quotes.  Elsewhere they are treated as
 *      quote characters.  The defaults for delimiter, quote, and escape
 *      are ',', '"', '"'.
 *   -  "regexp" splits each record using a regular expression (see QRegExp
 *      documentation for details).
 *   -  "whitespace" splits each record based on whitespace (on or more whitespace
 *      characters.  Leading whitespace in the record is ignored.
 *   -  "plain" is provided for backwards compatibility.  It is equivalent to
 *      CSV except that the default quote characters are single and double quotes,
 *      and there is no escape characters.
 *
 * - delimiter=characters
 *
 *   Defines the delimiter characters used for csv and plain type files, or the
 *   regular expression for regexp type files.  It is a literal string of characters
 *   except that "\t" may be used to represent a tab character.
 *
 * - quote=characters
 *
 *   Defines the characters that are used as quote characters for csv and plain type
 *   files.
 *
 * - escape=characters
 *
 *   Defines the characters used to escape delimiter, quote, and newline characters.
 *
 * - skipLines=n
 *
 *   Defines the number of lines to ignore at the beginning of the file (default 0)
 *
 * - useHeader=(yes|no)
 *
 *   Defines whether the first record in the file (after skipped lines) contains
 *   column names (default yes)
 *
 * - trimFields=(yes|no)
 *
 *   If yes then leading and trailing whitespace will be removed from fields
 *
 * - skipEmptyFields=(yes|no)
 *
 *   If yes then empty fields will be discarded (eqivalent to concatenating consecutive
 *   delimiters)
 *
 * - maxFields=#
 *
 *   Specifies the maximum number of fields to load for each record.  Additional
 *   fields will be discarded.  Default is 0 - load all fields.
 *
 * - decimalPoint=c
 *
 *   Defines a character that is used as a decimal point in the numeric columns
 *   The default is '.'.
 *
 * - xField=column yField=column
 *
 *   Defines the name of the columns holding the x and y coordinates for XY point geometries.
 *   If the useHeader is no (ie there are no column names), then this is the column
 *   number (with the first column as 1).
 *
 * - xyDms=(yes|no)
 *
 *   If yes then the X and Y coordinates are interpreted as
 *   degrees/minutes/seconds format (fairly permissively),
 *   or degree/minutes format.
 *
 * - wktField=column
 *
 *   Defines the name of the columns holding the WKT geometry definition for WKT geometries.
 *   If the useHeader is no (ie there are no column names), then this is the column
 *   number (with the first column as 1).
 *
 * - geomType=(point|line|polygon|none)
 *
 *   Defines the geometry type for WKT type geometries.  QGIS will only display one
 *   type of geometry for the layer - any others will be ignored when the file is
 *   loaded.  By default the provider uses the type of the first geometry in the file.
 *   Use geomType to override this type.
 *
 *   geomType can also be set to none, in which case the layer is loaded without
 *   geometries.
 *
 * - subset=expression
 *
 *   Defines an expression that will identify a subset of records to display
 *
 * - crs=crsstring
 *
 *   Defines the coordinate reference system used for the layer.  This can be
 *   any string accepted by QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::createFromString()
 *
 * -subsetIndex=(yes|no)
 *
 *   Determines whether the provider generates an index to improve the efficiency
 *   of subsets.  The default is yes
 *
 * -spatialIndex=(yes|no)
 *
 *   Determines whether the provider generates a spatial index.  The default is no.
 *
 * -watchFile=(yes|no)
 *
 *   Defines whether the file will be monitored for changes. The default is
 *   to monitor for changes.
 *
 * - quiet
 *
 *   Errors encountered loading the file will not be reported in a user dialog if
 *   quiet is included (They will still be shown in the output log).
 *
 * \subsection gpx GPX data provider (gpx)
 *
 * Provider reads tracks, routes, and waypoints from a GPX file.  The url
 * defines the name of the file, and the type of data to retrieve from it
 * ("track", "route", or "waypoint").
 *
 * An example url is "/home/user/data/holiday.gpx?type=route"
 *
 * \subsection grass Grass data provider (grass)
 *
 * Provider to display vector data in a GRASS GIS layer.
 *
 * TODO QGIS3: Remove virtual from non-inherited methods (like isModified)
 * @see QgsVectorLayerUtils()
